Hello World



FizzBuzz is solved as follows:



 Create a new file, named something



 like this: FizzBuzz.



 java





package Fizz



 Buzz



import java



 .



 ..



 fun main



 () {



 for ( int  i = 0;  i < 10;  i++) {



 // do something,



 and check whether  the output  was Fizz



 or Buzz.  }



 



 }



 In order  to generate some  numbers, we



 create a new  file, and



 write in the



 FizzBuzz



 file.



 We have  a function  named  for  loop



 to  generate some  numbers.
